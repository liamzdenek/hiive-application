# Active Context: Hiive AI Market Sentiment Analyzer

## Current Work Focus

We are developing a demo application for a job application to Hiive, a marketplace for private stock. The project aims to showcase:

1. Technical skills in modern web development (React, TypeScript)
2. Innovative use of AI for financial market analysis
3. Solving a real problem for Hiive: providing deeper insights into private market sentiment
4. How AI agents can automate complex research tasks
5. Deployment to Vercel for a live, accessible demo

The application will analyze market sentiment for pre-IPO companies by processing news articles, social media, and financial reports to provide Hiive users with deeper insights into potential investments.

## Recent Changes

This is a new project, so there are no recent changes to document. We are currently in the planning and architecture phase.

## Next Steps

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Set up project structure
   - Install required dependencies
   - Configure Vercel deployment

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Create basic layout components
   - Implement company selector
   - Build sentiment dashboard components
   - Develop data visualization charts
   - Implement responsive design

3. **Backend Development**
   - Set up Next.js API routes
   - Create serverless functions for sentiment analysis
   - Implement caching mechanism
   - Develop agent orchestrator

4. **AI Agent Implementation**
   - Configure LangChain.js
   - Implement news analysis agent
   - Implement social media analysis agent
   - Implement financial report analysis agent
   - Develop insight synthesis agent

5. **Integration & Testing**
   - Connect frontend to backend
   - Test end-to-end functionality
   - Optimize performance
   - Fix any bugs

6. **Deployment & Documentation**
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Set up environment variables
   - Create README with setup instructions
   - Document architecture and design decisions
   - Prepare demo script
   - Create presentation materials

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Next.js vs. Create React App**
   - Decision: Use Next.js for the frontend
   - Rationale: Next.js provides better performance, SEO capabilities, built-in API routes for serverless functions, and seamless deployment to Vercel
   - Status: Decided

2. **Backend Approach**
   - Decision: Use Next.js API Routes instead of a separate Express server
   - Rationale: Simplifies deployment to Vercel, eliminates need for separate hosting, and provides serverless scaling
   - Status: Decided

3. **State Management Approach**
   - Decision: Use React Context + Hooks for state management
   - Rationale: Appropriate for the scope of the demo, avoids unnecessary complexity
   - Status: Decided

4. **Data Sources**
   - Decision: Use a combination of real APIs and mock data
   - Rationale: Some data sources may require complex authentication or paid subscriptions
   - Status: Under consideration

5. **Deployment Platform**
   - Decision: Use Vercel for deployment
   - Rationale: Optimized for Next.js, provides serverless functions, global CDN, and simplified environment variable management
   - Status: Decided

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Scope Management**
   - Challenge: Ensuring the project is completable within 1-2 days
   - Approach: Focus on core functionality first, add enhancements if time permits
   - Status: Actively monitoring

2. **AI Performance**
   - Challenge: LLM API calls can be slow and expensive
   - Approach: Implement caching, consider pre-computing some results
   - Status: To be addressed during implementation

3. **Demo Data**
   - Challenge: Need realistic data for compelling demo
   - Approach: Create a curated dataset of pre-IPO companies with realistic sentiment patterns
   - Status: To be implemented

4. **UI/UX Design**
   - Challenge: Creating a polished interface that aligns with Hiive's aesthetic
   - Approach: Reference Hiive's website for design cues, use Tailwind for consistent styling
   - Status: To be implemented

5. **API Key Security**
   - Challenge: Securing API keys in a publicly deployed application
   - Approach: Use Vercel environment variables and Next.js API routes to proxy requests
   - Status: To be implemented

### Key Risks

1. **Time Constraint**
   - Risk: 1-2 day timeline is aggressive for the scope
   - Mitigation: Prioritize core features, use existing libraries, prepare fallback options

2. **API Limitations**
   - Risk: External APIs may have rate limits or require complex authentication
   - Mitigation: Prepare mock data as fallback, focus on demonstrating the concept

3. **Technical Complexity**
   - Risk: Integrating multiple AI agents could introduce complexity
   - Mitigation: Start with simple implementations, enhance if time permits

4. **Deployment Issues**
   - Risk: Unforeseen issues with Vercel deployment
   - Mitigation: Set up deployment early in the process, test with minimal viable application

## Current Priorities

1. Set up project structure and basic scaffolding
2. Configure Vercel deployment early
3. Implement core UI components
4. Develop basic AI agent functionality
5. Create compelling demo data
6. Ensure end-to-end functionality works
