# Active Context: Hiive AI Market Sentiment Analyzer

## Current Work Focus

We are developing a demo application for a job application to Hiive, a marketplace for private stock. The project aims to showcase:

1. Technical skills in modern web development (React, TypeScript)
2. Innovative use of AI for financial market analysis
3. Solving a real problem for Hiive: providing deeper insights into private market sentiment
4. How AI agents can automate complex research tasks
5. Infrastructure as code expertise with AWS CDK deployment

The application will analyze market sentiment for pre-IPO companies by processing news articles, social media, and financial reports to provide Hiive users with deeper insights into potential investments.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **React with Vite vs. Create React App**
   - Decision: Use React with Vite for the frontend
   - Rationale: Vite provides faster build times and a better development experience
   - Status: Decided

2. **Backend Approach**
   - Decision: Use AWS Lambda with Express adapter
   - Rationale: Serverless architecture aligns with modern practices and is cost-effective for demos
   - Status: Decided

3. **State Management Approach**
   - Decision: Use React Context + Hooks for state management
   - Rationale: Appropriate for the scope of the demo, avoids unnecessary complexity
   - Status: Decided

4. **Data Sources**
   - Decision: Use a combination of real APIs and mock data
   - Rationale: Some data sources may require complex authentication or paid subscriptions
   - Status: Under consideration

5. **Deployment Platform**
   - Decision: Use AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
   - Rationale: Demonstrates infrastructure as code expertise, provides consistent language across application and infrastructure
   - Status: Decided

6. **Desktop Script Implementation**
   - Decision: Use Node.js with Commander.js for CLI
   - Rationale: Provides a familiar development experience consistent with the rest of the stack
   - Status: Decided

7. **Article Storage Solution**
   - Decision: Use S3 for scale-to-zero article storage
   - Rationale: Cost-effective, only pay for what you use, integrates well with Lambda
   - Status: Decided

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Scope Management**
   - Challenge: Ensuring the project is completable within 1-2 days
   - Approach: Focus on core functionality first, add enhancements if time permits
   - Status: Actively monitoring

2. **AI Performance**
   - Challenge: LLM API calls can be slow and expensive
   - Approach: Implement caching, consider pre-computing some results
   - Status: To be addressed during implementation

3. **Demo Data**
   - Challenge: Need realistic data for compelling demo
   - Approach: Create a curated dataset of pre-IPO companies with realistic sentiment patterns
   - Status: To be implemented

4. **UI/UX Design**
   - Challenge: Creating a polished interface that aligns with Hiive's aesthetic
   - Approach: Reference Hiive's website for design cues, use Tailwind for consistent styling
   - Status: To be implemented

5. **API Key Security**
   - Challenge: Securing API keys in a deployed application
   - Approach: Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and secure Lambda access
   - Status: To be implemented

6. **AWS Infrastructure**
   - Challenge: Creating a secure, cost-effective infrastructure
   - Approach: Follow AWS best practices, utilize free tier where possible
   - Status: To be implemented

7. **Desktop Script Distribution**
   - Challenge: Making the desktop script easy to install and use
   - Approach: Package as an npm module with clear documentation
   - Status: To be implemented

8. **S3 Storage Management**
   - Challenge: Efficiently managing article storage and retrieval
   - Approach: Implement lifecycle policies and organize with clear prefixes
   - Status: To be implemented

### Key Risks

1. **Time Constraint**
   - Risk: 1-2 day timeline is aggressive for the scope
   - Mitigation: Prioritize core features, use existing libraries, prepare fallback options

2. **API Limitations**
   - Risk: External APIs may have rate limits or require complex authentication
   - Mitigation: Prepare mock data as fallback, focus on demonstrating the concept

3. **Technical Complexity**
   - Risk: Integrating multiple AI agents could introduce complexity
   - Mitigation: Start with simple implementations, enhance if time permits

4. **Deployment Issues**
   - Risk: Unforeseen issues with AWS CDK deployment
   - Mitigation: Set up deployment early in the process, test with minimal viable application

5. **AWS Costs**
   - Risk: Incurring unexpected AWS costs
   - Mitigation: Utilize free tier services, implement proper cleanup procedures

6. **Desktop Script Usability**
   - Risk: Desktop script may be difficult for users to install or use
   - Mitigation: Focus on simple installation process, clear documentation, and robust error handling

7. **S3 Security**
   - Risk: Improper S3 configuration could expose sensitive data
   - Mitigation: Implement proper IAM policies, bucket policies, and encryption

1. Set up project structure and basic scaffolding
2. Initialize AWS CDK project and define basic infrastructure
3. Implement core UI components
4. Develop desktop script for article submission
5. Configure S3 storage for articles
6. Develop basic AI agent functionality
