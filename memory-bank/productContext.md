# Product Context: Hiive AI Market Sentiment Analyzer

## Why This Project Exists
Hiive operates in the private stock marketplace where information asymmetry is a significant challenge. Unlike public markets with standardized disclosures, private market participants often lack comprehensive data to make informed decisions. This project aims to demonstrate how AI can help bridge this information gap by analyzing sentiment across various sources to provide deeper insights into pre-IPO companies.

## Problems It Solves

### For Investors & Funds
- **Information Asymmetry**: Private markets lack the transparency of public markets. This tool aggregates and analyzes sentiment from diverse sources to provide a more complete picture.
- **Research Efficiency**: Manually tracking sentiment across news, social media, and financial reports is time-consuming. AI agents can automate this process.
- **Decision Support**: Provides additional context beyond pricing data to inform investment decisions.

### For Sellers
- **Timing Optimization**: Helps sellers understand market sentiment trends to potentially time their sales more effectively.
- **Valuation Context**: Provides additional context around current valuations by correlating them with sentiment trends.

### For Issuers
- **Market Perception Monitoring**: Allows companies to monitor how they're perceived in the market.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Offers insights into sentiment around competitors and the broader industry.

## How It Should Work

1. **Data Collection**: AI agents continuously monitor and collect relevant information about pre-IPO companies from:
   - News articles
   - Social media mentions
   - Financial analyst reports
   - Industry publications
   - Regulatory filings

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: LLMs process the collected information to:
   - Determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral)
   - Identify key topics and themes
   - Extract relevant financial insights
   - Detect significant events or announcements

3. **Insight Generation**: The system synthesizes analyzed data to generate actionable insights:
   - Sentiment trends over time
   - Correlation between sentiment and valuation changes
   - Comparison with industry peers
   - Identification of potential risk factors or growth opportunities

4. **Visualization & Reporting**: The frontend presents insights through:
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Sentiment trend charts
   - Topic analysis visualizations
   - Alert systems for significant sentiment shifts

## User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, modern UI that aligns with Hiive's existing design language.
- **Actionable Insights**: Focus on presenting information that drives decision-making rather than raw data.
- **Seamless Integration**: Design the experience to feel like a natural extension of Hiive's platform.
- **Transparency**: Clearly communicate the sources and methodology behind sentiment analysis.
- **Efficiency**: Deliver insights quickly and in a format that minimizes cognitive load.
