## Current Status

Project has moved from planning to initial implementation. The basic structure and configuration are in place, and development of core components has begun.

## Known Issues

1. TypeScript errors in some files due to missing dependencies (will be resolved after `npm install`)
2. Frontend build requires proper Vite configuration
3. Backend needs proper Express types for request and response objects
4. CDK stacks need complete implementation of AWS resources
