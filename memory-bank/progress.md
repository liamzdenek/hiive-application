## Current Status

The backend infrastructure has been successfully implemented and deployed to AWS. The API Gateway, Lambda functions, and S3 storage are all working correctly. The desktop CLI for article submission is also complete.

The frontend has been fully implemented and deployed to AWS. It features a functional dashboard with all the necessary components for displaying sentiment analysis data. We've also added an article upload interface that allows users to submit articles directly from the web application. The interface includes form validation, a sample article loader for quick testing, and proper integration with the backend API. A loading screen has been added to improve the user experience while data is being fetched.

The application now provides two ways to submit articles for analysis: through the desktop CLI for batch processing and through the web interface for individual submissions. The entire application is now deployed and fully functional in the AWS environment.

## Known Issues

1. ~~Frontend build requires proper Vite configuration~~ (Resolved: Frontend build and deployment completed successfully)
2. API Gateway to Express integration needs to be tested with more complex scenarios
3. ~~Sentiment analysis is currently using a simple keyword-based approach, which could be enhanced~~ (Resolved: Now using meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct through OpenRouter)
4. ~~Need to implement proper error handling for edge cases in the Lambda functions~~ (Resolved: Implemented robust error handling in Lambda functions)
5. Fixed Lambda bundling configuration to include aws-sdk as a nodeModule instead of an externalModule
6. OpenRouter API key must be provided as an environment variable during deployment
