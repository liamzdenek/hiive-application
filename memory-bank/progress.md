## Current Status

The backend infrastructure has been successfully implemented and deployed to AWS. The API Gateway, Lambda functions, and S3 storage are all working correctly. The desktop CLI for article submission is also complete. The focus now shifts to implementing the frontend components and connecting them to the backend API.

## Known Issues

1. Frontend build requires proper Vite configuration
2. API Gateway to Express integration needs to be tested with more complex scenarios
3. Sentiment analysis is currently using a simple keyword-based approach, which could be enhanced
4. Need to implement proper error handling for edge cases in the Lambda functions
5. Fixed Lambda bundling configuration to include aws-sdk as a nodeModule instead of an externalModule
