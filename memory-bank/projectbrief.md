# Project Brief: Hiive AI Market Sentiment Analyzer

## Overview
Create a demo application that showcases how Agentic AI can enhance Hiive's private market data insights. The application will analyze market sentiment for pre-IPO companies by processing news articles, social media, and financial reports to provide Hiive users with deeper insights into potential investments.

## Core Requirements
1. Develop a web application with a React/TypeScript frontend
2. Implement an AI-powered sentiment analysis system using LLMs
3. Create a dashboard to visualize sentiment trends for companies in Hiive's marketplace
4. Demonstrate how this could integrate with Hiive's existing platform
5. Deploy the application using AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
6. Complete within 1-2 days of development time

## Goals
- Showcase technical skills in modern web development (React, TypeScript)
- Demonstrate innovative use of AI for financial market analysis
- Solve a real problem for Hiive: providing deeper insights into private market sentiment
- Highlight how AI agents can automate complex research tasks
- Present a polished, production-ready demo that could be extended into a full feature
- Demonstrate infrastructure as code expertise with AWS CDK deployment

## Success Criteria
- Application successfully analyzes sentiment from multiple sources
- UI is intuitive and aligns with Hiive's design aesthetic
- Performance is optimized for quick insights delivery
- Code is well-structured, documented, and maintainable
- Project demonstrates clear value-add for Hiive's platform
- Infrastructure is defined as code using AWS CDK
- Application is successfully deployed to AWS

## Constraints
- Must be completable within 1-2 days
- Should focus on demonstrating core functionality rather than building a complete product
- Must leverage AI agents for data processing and analysis
- Should align with Hiive's tech stack preferences (React, TypeScript, GraphQL)
- Must use AWS CDK for infrastructure definition and deployment
