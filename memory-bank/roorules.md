# Hiive AI Market Sentiment Analyzer - Project Intelligence

## Project Context
- This is a job application project for Hiive, a marketplace for private stock
- The project needs to be completable in 1-2 days
- It should showcase both technical skills and understanding of Hiive's business
- It leverages Agentic AI development workflows to solve a problem uniquely relevant to Hiive
- The application must be deployed to Vercel for easy access and demonstration

## Critical Implementation Paths
- Focus on creating a compelling UI that aligns with Hiive's design aesthetic
- Implement AI agents that demonstrate practical value for private market analysis
- Ensure the project is well-structured and follows best practices
- Create realistic demo data that showcases the potential of the application
- Configure Vercel deployment early to identify and resolve any issues

## User Preferences and Workflow
- The application should feel like a natural extension of Hiive's platform
- Focus on providing actionable insights rather than raw data
- Prioritize visual appeal and intuitive user experience
- Ensure the demo clearly communicates how this could add value to Hiive's business
- Make the demo easily accessible through a public Vercel URL

## Project-Specific Patterns
- Use Next.js with React and TypeScript for frontend development
- Leverage Next.js API routes for serverless backend functionality
- Implement AI agents using LangChain.js
- Follow a component-based architecture
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure rapid development
- Implement caching for expensive AI operations
- Use Vercel for deployment and hosting

## Known Challenges
- Time constraint of 1-2 days requires careful scope management
- LLM API calls can be slow and expensive
- External APIs may have rate limits or require complex authentication
- Balancing technical sophistication with practical implementation
- Securing API keys in a publicly deployed application

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decided to use Next.js over Create React App for better performance, developer experience, and Vercel deployment
- Chose to use Next.js API routes instead of a separate Express server for simplified deployment
- Selected React Context + Hooks for state management due to appropriate scope
- Decided to use a combination of real APIs and mock data to ensure a compelling demo
- Chose Vercel as the deployment platform for its seamless integration with Next.js

## Tool Usage Patterns
- Use VSCode with recommended extensions for development
- Leverage TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Implement ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Use Git for version control
- Utilize React Query for data fetching and caching
- Configure Vercel CLI for local testing of serverless functions
- Use environment variables for secure configuration
